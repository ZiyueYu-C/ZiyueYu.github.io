This Ziyue Yu<br>
Here is some practice about how to build up my own website

I graduated from Southern University of Science and Technology as a Bachelor of Science, major in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. <br>
<br>
Now, I am a Ph.D candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Pittsburgh, foucsing on 2D turbulent flow, PIV particle tracking algorithm
and biogenic mixing.<br>

My recent program was relevant to observe the energy flux in different experiment condition, however, with similar Reynolds number. Based on the latest research in our lab, we observed energy flux in turbulent flow can be manipulate by modify the coupling of the eigenvector of background shear flow and 
stress which generated by Energy injection. We try to extend this work to low Reynolds number regime, which indicate that even extremely low Re number, can generate relative high energy flux. <br> 

I am happy to share my experience and research here! I hope my website may help you.<br>

<br>
Best wishes! And have a good everyday!
